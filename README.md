A
**Difference between imperative and functional programming:**
imperative programming want the developer to write down the steps which specifies how the computer must accomplish the goal while in functional programming the developer have to call function to specifies  what the computer must do to accomplish the goal. 

B
**Declarative programming:** It describe the desired end result rather than outlining all the intermediate work steps that the computer must go through.
**Eg:** 
		Int[] values = new Int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};

		IntStream.of(values)
			.filter(value -> value % 2 == 0)
			.sorted()
			.forEach(value -> System.out.printf("%d ", value));
			
C
Including functional style programming in java make it possible to write java programs in more concisely way, in more readable way,in more thread-safe, parallelizable and more maintainable way.
